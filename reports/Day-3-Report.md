## Observations
- Daily report correctly lists inbox metrics, spam stats, important flagged emails, and deadlines detected.

- Placeholder AI summaries are working for now, ready to integrate with real LLMs later.

## Next Steps

- Replace placeholder AI summaries with real LLM calls.
- Implement downloads cleanup automation.
- Add logging improvements for production readiness.
